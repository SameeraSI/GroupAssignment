# Jaseci Group Assignment
This repository contains the code for our Jaseci group assignment. Jaseci is a framework for building and executing complex automation tasks, and this assignment involves implementing a specific use case using Jaseci.

# New Additions
We updated the Jaseci program with adding two new walkers that enhance the functionality of the program. <br><br>

The first walker is designed to identify all male members in families. This feature will be particularly useful for projects that require gender-specific analysis. With this new addition, users can easily extract all male family members from their datasets and perform targeted analyses.<br><br>

The second walker is designed to extract all movie categories that are favorites among family members. This feature will allow users to gain insights into the viewing preferences of family members and tailor recommendations accordingly.<br><br>
